A JavaScript-based Wordle-style game updated daily where the player guesses a randomly selected BLEACH character! THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED, WITH A NEW VERSION IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, it is STILL fully-functional, beautified, and live at <a href="">https://tybwardle.com</a>!

Using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, I was able to create a game inspired by the New York Times' Wordle game that allows for players to guess a new random character, updated daily! External images sourced from the <a href="https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/Bleach_Wiki">official BLEACH wiki</a> and an <a href="https://watercss.kognise.dev/">external style sheet</a> were used for the creation of this game!

## TO-DO:
1. ~~Fully complete mobile optimization (about 80-90% formatted).~~ ✅
2. ~~Create cron job that automatically updates today.json with a random entry from characters.json for the random daily characters!~~ ✅
3. Add share results functionality (copy/paste from template w/ navigator.clipboard.writeText() method)
4. Add login/save results function (utilize Passport.js/Firebase for login/logout (?))
